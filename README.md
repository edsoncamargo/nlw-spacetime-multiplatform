# Spacetime

![Spacetime Logo](./mobile/assets/icon.svg)

**Spacetime** is an application for remembering memories, where the user can add texts, photos and videos of important events in their life to a timeline, organized by month and year. Available as both a mobile app and web version, Spacetime offers a unified, accessible experience on any device. This project was developed as part of a hands-on session during the NLW Ignite (Rocketseat).

## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this project:

### Server

- **NodeJS**: Is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Fastify**: Is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
- **Prisma**: Is a next-generation ORM that consists of these tools:

  - Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
  - Prisma Migrate: Declarative data modeling & migration system
  - Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database

- **Zod**: Is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.
- **Axios**: Is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.

### Mobile

- **React Native**: It's a mobile app development framework that allows you to build native apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. It enables mobile app development with a single codebase, providing a native user experience.
- **Expo**: It's an open-source platform and set of tools for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React Native. Expo provides a range of ready-to-use components and APIs that streamline app development, including access to features like camera, geolocation, and push notifications.
- **Nativewind**: NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.
- **Axios**: Is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
- **Dayjs**: Is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.

### Web

- **ReactJS**: It's a mobile app development framework that allows you to build native apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. It enables mobile app development with a single codebase, providing a native user experience.
- **Next**: Is a React framework for building web applications with features like server-side rendering and static site generation. It simplifies the development process, allowing developers to focus on app logic while handling technical complexities seamlessly.
- **Tailwind**: Is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for quick and consistent styling of HTML elements.

### GitHub OAuth

JWT (JSON Web Token) √© uma forma compacta e segura de representar informa√ß√µes entre duas partes, frequentemente usada para autentica√ß√£o e autoriza√ß√£o em aplica√ß√µes web.
